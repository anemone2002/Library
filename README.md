# Lin Library Management
This project is a Library Management System built using Spring Framework with Spring Boot and Maven as the build tool. The application allows librarians to perform CRUD operations on two entities: Book and Borrower, which have a many-to-many relationship. The Book entity has fields like id, title, author, publisher, and ISBN. The Borrower entity has fields like id, name, email, and phone number. The application uses Thymeleaf as the view template engine, Spring Data JPA to interact with the database, and Hibernate as the ORM tool. The database used is either MySQL or PostgreSQL.
